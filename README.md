- Goals and objectives of the project

## Installation
Once you are in the directory containing the requirements.txt file, run the following command:
$pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
data_visualization.py usage:
- Add the csv-filename into the "filename" variable
- $python data_visualization.py

wind_and_dropssplitting.py usage:
- On the bottom input parameters can be changed accordingly
- Either "run_simulation()" or "animate_CA()" can be used 
- "run_simulation()" simulates without showing the Cellular Automata Animation
- "animate_CA()" simulates while showing the Cellular Automata Animation
- $wind_and_dropssplitting.py
